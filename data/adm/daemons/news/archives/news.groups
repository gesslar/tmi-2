Since all the discussion of bad Tmi-2 1.2 DNS systems, Intermud,
etc, it might be nice to make a socket group..  something like
mud.socket.dns, or mud.socket.interboard would both be
nice.. :0

I suggest that, once this thing is relatively well debugged, all
or most of the bulletin boards be converted into separate newsgroups.

This will allow people reading posts to sit in their workroom and not
have it interrupted by conversations, people walking by, etc.  And
people who wanna sit in the main area and talk can do so without having
to figure out which five people are reading/posting and should be ignored.

This group carries discussion of what new newsgroups should be created
on TMI-2 and what existing groups can be removed. At this time the
mechanism by which new groups can be created hasn't been determined:
some discussion of ways to organize that would also be appropriate for
this group.

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

(I've been pondering to make a newsreader/poster for DGD and get/post
 in the usenet groups.)

It shouldn't be very hard to rig a bulletin board to query the

be a bit trickier but should not be impossible.

How about a nice bulletin board interface for news?
I mean,. it's the TMI tradition to use bulletin boards
for gathering information, and while here, I tend to
prefer it over a Usenet-ish look and feel.  If I want
to read newsgroups, I can go to Idea Exchange; while
here I'd like the option of getting my information the
"old-fashioned" way - from a bulletin board.

Realistically speaking, it would be possible to route
newsgroups through the bulletin board interface that
TMI uses...keeping the "world-at-large" which can be
explored, and the newsgroups, in line might prove a
little tricky, but I think it would be possible.

What I'm afraid of seeing is two staggeringly different
info systems (from an interface perspective) continuing,
and redundant posts getting placed all over the place,
or missing something important because of not having the
time to read both news arenas.  Somehow, I'd like to see
the systems merge and blend together somewhat; the
bboard front end, for instance, and the news backend.

	Agreed.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed
through normal email. And news. Besides, i don't much like the
idea of losing my mud because some git decides to post something
inflammatory from it either.

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlibs combined. Usenet reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide
a very Tolkienique mud with alt.fan.tolkien, a sf mud with
rec.arts.science-fiction and rec.tv.startrek, or whatever a mud wants,
then redesigning usenet on microlevel, with a handful of groups.

	Oh? you've never run across a creator who wasn't

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you

	What you're talking about is designing a mud type OS. That,
i agree, would be riotous fun. However, we are discussing MUDs here.
Games. I don't really think that your average player enters a mud
for the express pleasure of reading rec.fish. I could be wrong, of
course.
	The number of people that Usenet reaches completely 
irrelevant. We're interested in muds. I agree with you - the fun
you get out of playing with IP protocols vastly outweighs mud ones
- but, once again, we are designing MUD protocols. There's a distinct
difference.

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlib writes combined. Usenet has reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide

	Oh? you've never run across a creator who wasn't
the most civil of individuals?

	I do envy you. I've met more than one. If one of those comes up with
something as wonderful on Usenet as they have done on intermud, then
i would be amazed if my account wasn't instantaneously revoked.

	As for cheating - intermud is something between muds. It should
stay that way. It's vastly more fun to provide services that you've written
yourself from the ground up. After all - that's why people write mudlibs
and everything else.

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you
HAVE TO give all your players posting rights to all groups, but it's
an OPTION with comes with NO EXTRA CHARGE.

Being afraid to lose your mud is a non-argument.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlibs combined. Usenet reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide
a very Tolkienique mud with alt.fan.tolkien, a sf mud with
rec.arts.science-fiction and rec.tv.startrek, or whatever a mud wants,
then redesigning usenet on microlevel, with a handful of groups.

the most civil of individuals?

	I do envy you. I've met more than one. If one of those comes up with
something as wonderful on Usenet as they have done on intermud, then

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you
HAVE TO give all your players posting rights to all groups, but it's
an OPTION with comes with NO EXTRA CHARGE.

Being afraid to lose your mud is a non-argument.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

To reply to Abigails remark concerning 'other muds who might want 
to access all of Usenet'

I'm working on a nntp.c which will allow communication
with your local Usenet nntp server. What groups you want
to feed is your problem. What groups you want to serve
is your problem.
What I will not implement myself is a 'piggyback' system
to use Usenet for mud groups.


I already have the TCP port listening, and I am working on
adding a UDP port too, for those muds not using Amylaar.

It's obvious that if you want to incorporate Usenet groups,
that you might as well make the mud groups and local (your mud
only groups) in the same format.
I haven't looked at the rn code, but I assume it's easy to
tie those two together.

To reply to Abigails remark concerning 'other muds who might want 
to access all of Usenet'

I'm working on a nntp.c which will allow communication
with your local Usenet nntp server. What groups you want
to feed is your problem. What groups you want to serve
is your problem.
What I will not implement myself is a 'piggyback' system
to use Usenet for mud groups.


I already have the TCP port listening, and I am working on
adding a UDP port too, for those muds not using Amylaar.

It's obvious that if you want to incorporate Usenet groups,
that you might as well make the mud groups and local (your mud
only groups) in the same format.
I haven't looked at the rn code, but I assume it's easy to
tie those two together.

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlibs combined. Usenet reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide
a very Tolkienique mud with alt.fan.tolkien, a sf mud with
rec.arts.science-fiction and rec.tv.startrek, or whatever a mud wants,
then redesigning usenet on microlevel, with a handful of groups.

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

It shouldn't be very hard to rig a bulletin board to query the

be a bit trickier but should not be impossible.
I'll provide a directory to anyone who wants to work on this but
doesn't have anywhere else to do it.

How about a nice bulletin board interface for news?
I mean,. it's the TMI tradition to use bulletin boards
for gathering information, and while here, I tend to
prefer it over a Usenet-ish look and feel.  If I want
to read newsgroups, I can go to Idea Exchange; while
here I'd like the option of getting my information the
"old-fashioned" way - from a bulletin board.

Realistically speaking, it would be possible to route
newsgroups through the bulletin board interface that
TMI uses...keeping the "world-at-large" which can be
explored, and the newsgroups, in line might prove a
little tricky, but I think it would be possible.

What I'm afraid of seeing is two staggeringly different
info systems (from an interface perspective) continuing,
and redundant posts getting placed all over the place,
or missing something important because of not having the
time to read both news arenas.  Somehow, I'd like to see
the systems merge and blend together somewhat; the
bboard front end, for instance, and the news backend.

Just a few random thougts...

	What you're talking about is designing a mud type OS. That,
i agree, would be riotous fun. However, we are discussing MUDs here.
Games. I don't really think that your average player enters a mud
for the express pleasure of reading rec.fish. I could be wrong, of
course.
	The number of people that Usenet reaches completely 
irrelevant. We're interested in muds. I agree with you - the fun
you get out of playing with IP protocols vastly outweighs mud ones
- but, once again, we are designing MUD protocols. There's a distinct
difference.

How about a nice bulletin board interface for news?
I mean,. it's the TMI tradition to use bulletin boards
for gathering information, and while here, I tend to
prefer it over a Usenet-ish look and feel.  If I want
to read newsgroups, I can go to Idea Exchange; while
here I'd like the option of getting my information the
"old-fashioned" way - from a bulletin board.

Realistically speaking, it would be possible to route
newsgroups through the bulletin board interface that
TMI uses...keeping the "world-at-large" which can be
explored, and the newsgroups, in line might prove a
little tricky, but I think it would be possible.

What I'm afraid of seeing is two staggeringly different
info systems (from an interface perspective) continuing,
and redundant posts getting placed all over the place,
or missing something important because of not having the
time to read both news arenas.  Somehow, I'd like to see
the systems merge and blend together somewhat; the

To reply to Abigails remark concerning 'other muds who might want 
to access all of Usenet'

I'm working on a nntp.c which will allow communication
with your local Usenet nntp server. What groups you want
to feed is your problem. What groups you want to serve
is your problem.
What I will not implement myself is a 'piggyback' system
to use Usenet for mud groups.


I already have the TCP port listening, and I am working on
adding a UDP port too, for those muds not using Amylaar.

It's obvious that if you want to incorporate Usenet groups,
that you might as well make the mud groups and local (your mud
only groups) in the same format.
I haven't looked at the rn code, but I assume it's easy to
tie those two together.

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlibs combined. Usenet reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide
a very Tolkienique mud with alt.fan.tolkien, a sf mud with
rec.arts.science-fiction and rec.tv.startrek, or whatever a mud wants,
then redesigning usenet on microlevel, with a handful of groups.

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you
HAVE TO give all your players posting rights to all groups, but it's
an OPTION with comes with NO EXTRA CHARGE.

Being afraid to lose your mud is a non-argument.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

(I've been pondering to make a newsreader/poster for DGD and get/post
 in the usenet groups.)

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you
HAVE TO give all your players posting rights to all groups, but it's
an OPTION with comes with NO EXTRA CHARGE.

Being afraid to lose your mud is a non-argument.

	Agreed.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed
through normal email. And news. Besides, i don't much like the
idea of losing my mud because some git decides to post something
inflammatory from it either.

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

(I've been pondering to make a newsreader/poster for DGD and get/post

How about a nice bulletin board interface for news?
I mean,. it's the TMI tradition to use bulletin boards
for gathering information, and while here, I tend to
prefer it over a Usenet-ish look and feel.  If I want
to read newsgroups, I can go to Idea Exchange; while
here I'd like the option of getting my information the
"old-fashioned" way - from a bulletin board.

Realistically speaking, it would be possible to route
newsgroups through the bulletin board interface that
TMI uses...keeping the "world-at-large" which can be
explored, and the newsgroups, in line might prove a

What I'm afraid of seeing is two staggeringly different
info systems (from an interface perspective) continuing,

To reply to Abigails remark concerning 'other muds who might want

I'm working on a nntp.c which will allow communication
with your local Usenet nntp server. What groups you want
to feed is your problem. What groups you want to serve
is your problem.
What I will not implement myself is a 'piggyback' system
to use Usenet for mud groups.


I already have the TCP port listening, and I am working on
adding a UDP port too, for those muds not using Amylaar.

It's obvious that if you want to incorporate Usenet groups,
that you might as well make the mud groups and local (your mud
only groups) in the same format.
I haven't looked at the rn code, but I assume it's easy to

So you have an idiotic system admin, and you won't want people post on
non-mud specific groups. Good, then don't. But is that a reason why other
muds shouldn't get the groups they want? Why develop a protocol where muds
can only chose from a handful of groups in stead of one where muds can
choose from 5000 groups.

So, what did the people do who wrote A-news, B-news, C-news, NNTP etc do?
I think a lot more people have fun with the services provided by those people
than all mudlibs combined. Usenet reaches an estimated number of
40 million readers. I doubt the total number of people who ever visited a
mud is even close.

But if you like to stay in a small circle, that's fine. But I still don't
see any reason to spend time to develop a protocol which provides muds with
a dozen groups, when with less effort muds can choose any combination of
about 5000 groups to carry in their mud.

Personally I would have more fun in developping a news system which can provide
a very Tolkienique mud with alt.fan.tolkien, a sf mud with
rec.arts.science-fiction and rec.tv.startrek, or whatever a mud wants,
then redesigning usenet on microlevel, with a handful of groups.

	Oh? you've never run across a creator who wasn't
the most civil of individuals?

	I do envy you. I've met more than one. If one of those comes up with
something as wonderful on Usenet as they have done on intermud, then

	Oh? you've never run across a creator who wasn't
the most civil of individuals?

	I do envy you. I've met more than one. If one of those comes up with
something as wonderful on Usenet as they have done on intermud, then
i would be amazed if my account wasn't instantaneously revoked.

	As for cheating - intermud is something between muds. It should
stay that way. It's vastly more fun to provide services that you've written
yourself from the ground up. After all - that's why people write mudlibs
and everything else.

What do you mean by 'cheating'? Is this a contest? But why the fear
you would lose you mud because someone posts something unappropriate?
None one lost their normal site when a normal person does it.
Besides, having mudnews flow with usenet traffic doesn't mean you
HAVE TO give all your players posting rights to all groups, but it's
an OPTION with comes with NO EXTRA CHARGE.

Being afraid to lose your mud is a non-argument.

	Agreed.

	Intermud should be solely mud based. Using anything else
is cheating. This applies equally well to having mail routed
through normal email. And news. Besides, i don't much like the
idea of losing my mud because some git decides to post something
inflammatory from it either.

Well, I think intermud news is very nice, but it shouldn't be hard to go
"all the way", and offer written articles to the local inews programs.
In that case the usual usenet infrastructure takes care of the transport,
and new sites can easily hop in. Then you can also read rec.games.mud.*
from within the mud. No need for separate sockets between muds.

(I've been pondering to make a newsreader/poster for DGD and get/post
 in the usenet groups.)

I agree.. I think that stuff for mud related issues should go
in mud.*.. this way, players, etc can have groups such as
players.*, etc..  such mudgroups would be like mud.newsreaders.rn
mud.socket.ftpd, etc.. even though these names are longer than
newsreaders.rn it is more organized into the smaller groups..
i think we should have as FEW main groups as possible..

I would suggest to keeping the same logical order as IdeaExchange,
so we can merge the two together when we get intermud news off
the ground.
Then ie.* and tmi-2/* could be local groups and all others cold be shared.

It shouldn't be very hard to rig a bulletin board to query the
news_server.c and produce the usual result. Access to post might
be a bit trickier but should not be impossible.
I'll provide a directory to anyone who wants to work on this but
doesn't have anywhere else to do it.

How about a nice bulletin board interface for news?
I mean,. it's the TMI tradition to use bulletin boards
for gathering information, and while here, I tend to
prefer it over a Usenet-ish look and feel.  If I want
to read newsgroups, I can go to Idea Exchange; while
here I'd like the option of getting my information the
"old-fashioned" way - from a bulletin board.

Realistically speaking, it would be possible to route
newsgroups through the bulletin board interface that
TMI uses...keeping the "world-at-large" which can be
explored, and the newsgroups, in line might prove a
little tricky, but I think it would be possible.

What I'm afraid of seeing is two staggeringly different
info systems (from an interface perspective) continuing,
and redundant posts getting placed all over the place,
or missing something important because of not having the
time to read both news arenas.  Somehow, I'd like to see
the systems merge and blend together somewhat; the
bboard front end, for instance, and the news backend.

Just a few random thougts...
