# If an object is left alone for a certain time, then the

living hash table size : 47

# Object hash table size.
# Define this like you did with the strings; probably set to about 1/4 of

# The default error messages, used when the mudlib hasn't provided an

default fail message : What?
default error message: Armageddon shouts: Garbage In Garbage Out!

# The maximum buffer size is, what you'd guess, the maximum size of
