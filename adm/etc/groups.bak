# To define a group, simply put the group name in (name) followed by a list of
# names separated by colons.  To put a group in another group, simply put the
# name of the group in parens.  Note: if you include a group in another
# group, it must have been previously defined.
#
# Domain members are defined in a domain's d_master file.  To include a
# domain within a group, simply put the name of the domain in brackets,
# eg [Name].  Domain names should be capitalized.
#
# All whitespace and newlines are stripped out.
#
# To end group declaration, simply have a newline after the last member of
# the group with no trailing ':'

# This group runs the mud.
# You should probably hold the number of admins down as low as you can.
# They have global write access, and can screw things up if they don't
# understand them. Anyone who is not up to date on the mudlib should NOT
# have admin privileges.
