# This file controls the number of moon phases and their length.
# By adding more entries you can have planets with two moons and
# similar nutty things :)
# Each line is one moon phase: the number is the length and the string
# is what will be printed when the player looks in an outdoor room at
# night with clear weather.
# As usual, lines beginning with # or blank lines are ignored.
