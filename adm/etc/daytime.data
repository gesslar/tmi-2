# This file contains the phases of the day, their times, the message
# printed when that phase is in effect, and the message printed when
# the phase changes to the next phase.
# Each phase takes two lines of the file. The first line contains an
# integer and a string; the integer is the length of that phase in
# seconds and the string is the message describing that phase when the
# look command is invoked outdoors during clear weather.
# The second line contains an integer and a string: the integer is 1
# if this is a day phase (ie, light regardless of weather) or a night
# phase (light if clear weather, otherwise dark). The string is a message
# to be printed to all rooms when the phase ends.
# The number of phases and the total length of the day are defined in
# weather_d.h. If you change them, change that file also.
# file, change that also.
# Lines beginning with #, and blank lines, are ignored.
