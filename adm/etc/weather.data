# Weather defines.
# This file defines a set of weather states. The MUD switches randomly
# from state to state (Markov chain, if you know what that means). Each
# weather state has a particular message that is printed when the user looks
# in an outdoor room, and two that are printed when the weather changes
# state: one if the change is from an state listed earlier in the file and
# a second if the change is from a state listed later. (If you arrange
# states in the right order, you can have things work out right.)
# Thus, if the file is:
# Clear
# 120 0 60 40
# Rainy
# 30 1 80 20
# then the following things are true. Each sunny state lasts 120 seconds,
# and there's a 60% chance of staying sunny and 40% of rain. Each
# rainy state lasts 30 seconds, and there's a 80% chance of clearing up
# and a 20% chance of more rain. Rainy weather prevents you from seeing
# the sun, clear weather does not.
# The number of weather states is defined in weather_d.h. If you change
# this file, change that one too.

# The format is: One line for the time of the state and the inclemency.
# One line for the probabilities of changing. One line for the "getting
# worse" message and one for the "getting better" message. One line for
# the looking message to be printed when someone looks in an outdoor room.
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored.
