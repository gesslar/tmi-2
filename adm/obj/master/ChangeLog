	* /adm/obj/master/groups.c: When a domain is included in a group, 
	the domain's EUID is now included in the group list. Previously 
	only the domain's members were included.

	* /adm/obj/master/groups.c: optimized it; if load_groups() dies, 
	"groups" mapping isn't fubar'd; domains handled directly, using 
	brackets in /adm/etc/groups

	* adm/obj/master/access.c: blech...that should read 
	"optimizations"

	* adm/obj/master/access.c: minor options to arr[i..sizeof(arr)-j] 
	becoming arr[i..<j]

	* adm/obj/master/groups.c: yavie noticed that people were showing 
	up twice in groups...added code to avoid duplicates 
	(slower...sigh)

	* /adm/obj/master.c: applied Xantrax's domain_file() fix for 
	"/d/*" (the creator_file() stuff was already fixed earlier...see 
	log) to return NONAME instead of "*".

	* Moved master.c to master.funny. Prob got put here by accident by 
	someone at some time.

	* /adm/obj/master/groups.c: fixed load_groups() so that it 
	wouldn't keep reloading the groups list if it was already 
	loaded; this speeds up valid_read() and valid_write() quite a 
	lot! (Huge speed ups on my Amiga!) 

Wed Apr  6 04:26:03 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex2.net.ubc.ca)

	* /adm/obj/master/d_master.c: added query_domain_members() 
	function to return group_list
