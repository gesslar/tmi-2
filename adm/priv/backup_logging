'clean here' in the adventurer's hall barfed.
hmm... just tried scan -d and sc -d to see what objects are here.
Both of those choked too :-(.  I see an axe, an orc, and the board.
When I tried "sc -d" got an error about /adm/daemons/ref_d not
loading.

Scan through lib source, and make sure objects that need the BOARD
define get it from one file...it's currently defined in both mailer.h and
mudlib.h...and cause a redefinition warning on some files (eg /cmds/wiz/_mail.c)

Double check and fix channels.
Intermud channels are called imud_code and imud_gossip. Here we're
translating them to code and gwiz.
Prob change gwiz into igossip. code can stay the same
Esp with emotes we get problems. Eg referencing gwiz is fine , except when using emotes

Query : Thystonius at Sat Mar  9 06:50:01 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/quad
I have been reading all through your documentation.  Unfortunately
Some of it points to a creation.c file supposably located in
/adm/obj..

Any idea of what happened to it would surely be of help.  I'm trying
to get my mud up and running, and I think TMI is one of the best
documented systems.  I would like to look at the stat structure,
race structure, and change them.

I did an rlog all, and saw brainstorm's complaint about color, in
correct colors... when I viewed it with log BUGS, I saw it with the
% ^ things still in there.
also, I ftp'd in a color _who.c (~ciao/cmds/_colorwho.c) and it also
doens't work right.... I see the % ^ COLOR % ^ strings.

Idea : Ciao at Mon May  6 07:50:43 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/bugroom
I have a niiiice version of _who.c that shows uses color and give
a bit more information than the regular _who.c  it's ~ciao/cmds/_colorwho.c
once you get write to correctly parse % ^ COLOR % ^ strings, you might
want to install it.
