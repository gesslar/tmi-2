	* I3.c - sends a special flag to the channels daemon now, to tell 
	it that we just send a startupreq1 message and the channels need 
	to be registered with the router again

	* Modified ftpd.c because atoi is not being found. (About line 
	1002, internally commented.)

	* Added reconnect check in the I3 router in case a socket to the 
	I3 router is lost. This was long overdue :)

	* /www/gateways/dirlist.c: renamed from "source.c"; changed http.c 
	accordingly

	* Removed the sending of chanlist-req. There is no such packet. 
	:-) I did only the most minor work; there are various cleanup 
	activities to do now...
