Ragnarok###
It starts to snow.  Slowly at first, then progressively heavier.  The warmth
leaches out of your bones.  You feel as if the Fimbulvetr is at hand.
###
You hear a vast but distant howl.  Looking up you see something resembling
a shaggy jaw eclipse the sun, stealing its brightness.  Only twilight remains.
###
Loki has escaped!  You hear him free his son, Fenris the wolf, when
with a malicous snap the dwarven chains break forever.
###
The fabric of space shudders as Nidhug the dragon of Niflheim severs
one of Yggdrasil's roots, freeing the terrible Garm, hound of Hel.
###
Taraaaa.  Tantantaraaaa.  Gjallarhorn resounds as Heimdal blows warning
of giants approaching Bifrost - the rainbow bridge.
###
Wails fill the air as Jormungand - the midguard serpent, rises from the
depths of the sea to spew venom o'er the world, poisoning a multitude.
###
Naglfari - the ship made from dead men's nail clipping, brings Loki and
the fire giants of Muspellsheim towards Asgard.
###
The frost giants of Jotunheim sail to Vigrid, led by the goddess Hel,
and join up with the other forces to attack the Aesir.
###
In a terrible and horrific display, Bifrost shatters under the weight
of the battling hordes, spilling corpses like scarlet rain.
###
Odin is slain by Fenris but is revenged when Fenris is slain by Vidar Odinson.
###
Thor kills Jormungand, but only takes nine steps before dying of the venom.
###
Surt, king of the fire giants, kills Frey, Vanir god of winter.
###
Loki and Heimdal fight each other to the death, as do Tyr and Garm.
###
Surt sets fire to Yggdrasil.  The blaze spreads, consuming the Nine Worlds.
###
The stars go out and the earth sinks into the sea.
