     NAME
          Living properties - common properties in the living object


     SYNOPSIS
          set ( <property>, <value> );


     DESCRIPTION
          The following properties are defined for the living object:

          name
              Name of the object. Not to be confused with
              set_living_name which is used by find_living, and which
              remains (it's an efun).

          cap_name
              A string which is the capitalized name of the living
              object.

          no_attack
              An integer which, if set to 1, prevents players from
              attacking the living object. Useful for quest item
              receivers, shopkeepers and other living objects that
              should not vanish.

          gender
              Sex of the living object, as a string.  set("gender",
              "sex") replaces set_gender("sex") in most applications.

          capacity
              The total amount of mass that can be added to the
              objects current inventory before it can't carry more. As
              items are increased, capacity drops, and as items are
              dropped capacity rises. A player carrying no items or
              gold has a capacity of 5000.

          volume
              The total amount of bulk that can be added to the
              object's current inventory before it cannot carry more.
              Like capacity, it is remaining volume available, not
              absolute volume.
