Commonly Used Properties in the Living Object

name. Name is the name of the object. Not to be confused with set_living_name
which is used by find_living, and which remains (it's an efun).

cap_name. Cap_name is a string which is the capitalized name of the
living object.

no_attack. no_attack is an integer which, if set to 1, prevents players from
attacking the living object. Useful for quest item receivers, shopkeepers and
other living objects that should not vanish.

gender. Gender is a string that is determines the sex of the living object.
set("gender", "sex") replaces set_gender("sex") in most applications.

capacity. Capacity is the total amount of mass that can be added to the
objects current inventory before it can't carry more. As items are increased,
capacity drops, and as items are dropped capacity rises. A player carrying
no items or gold has a capacity of 5000.

volume. Volume is the total amount of bulk that can be added to the
object's current inventory before it cannot carry more. Like capacity, it
is remaining volume available, not absolute volume.
