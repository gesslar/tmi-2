     NAME
          Room Properties - common properties in the room object


     SYNOPSIS
          set ( <property>, <value> ) ;


     DESCRIPTION
          Rooms use the common object properties short, long, and
          light. In addition, they also use the following special
          properties:

          exits
               A mapping whose keys are the directions the player can
               go and whose values are the filenames of the rooms the
               exit takes him to. For example:

               set ("exits", ([ "north" : "/d/TMI/partyroom.c" ]) ) ;

               would give the room one exit, north, which would take
               the player to the party room in the TMI domain. One can
               also use:

               add ("exits", ([ "south" : "/d/TMI/drunktank.c" ]) ) ;

               which would add a new exit to the existing ones. One
               can also use:

               remove ("exits/south") ;

               which would remove the south exit.

          item_desc
               A mapping whose keys are the names of things mentioned
               in the room description and whose values are string to
               be returned if the player looks at those things. This
               makes it possible to give descriptions to items in the
               room without having to clone up actual objects. For
               example, suppose the room did:

               set ("long", "This is a room with a single chair in the
               middle") ;
               set ("item_desc", ([ "chair" : "This chair is very
               rickety and would collapse if you sat in it." ]) ) ;

               Then, if a player entered the room and typed "look at
               chair", he would see the description of the chair, even
               though there is not an actual chair object in the room.

          item_func
               A mapping whose keys are the names of things mentioned

               in the room description and whose values are functions
               to be called if the player looks at the item. For
               example, one can create the famous painting portal by
               doing this:

               set ("item_func", ([ "painting", "teleport" ]) ) ;
               int teleport() {
                    // code to move the player to another room

               and then, if a player enters the room and types "look
               at painting", the function teleport will be called and
               the player will be bamfed to wherever to code sends
               him. There are many other possible creative uses for
               this property.

          objects
               A mapping whose keys are the ids of objects and whose
               values are the filenames of those objects. When the
               room is reset, any object in the objects property which
               is not present will be cloned and moved to the room.
               This avoids having to manually write a lot of reset
               procedures in your rooms. For example, a room
               containing this code:

               set ("objects", ([ "orc" : "/obj/orc", "chair 2" :
               "/obj/chair", "chair 2" : "/obj/chair" ]) ) ;

               will, at reset time, bring the contents of the room up
               to one orc and two chairs, cloning new items as needed
               to make that happen.

          pre_exit_func
               A mapping whose keys are the directions that a player
               can exit the room and whose values are functions that
               will be called in the room just before the player
               leaves. For example, if the room code contains:

               set ("pre_exit_message", ([ "north" : "foo" ]) ) ;

               then whenever a player left the room via the north
               exit, the function foo would be called just BEFORE the
               player left the room.
               If the function returns 1, then the player will not be
               allowed to leave the room.

          post_exit_func
               A mapping whose keys are directions and whose values
               are functions to be called just AFTER the player leaves
               the room. The only difference between pre_exit_func and
               post_exit_func is that the moving player is in the room
               sent to the leaving player.

          exit_msg
               A mapping which allows you to supersede the usual "Fred

               leaves east" message with a special message for that
               room. For example, if you had a room full of mirrors,
               you might:

               set ("exit_msg", ([ "north" : "$N leaves, but the
               mirrors make it impossible to know what direction he
               went.0) ;

               then that message would be displayed whenever the
               player went north. If there is no exit_msg for a
               direction, then the default message is used, either "$N
               leaves $D" for a player or a wizard's custom message.
