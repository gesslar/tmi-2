     NAME
          Monster Properties - common properties in monsters


     SYNOPSIS
          set ( <property>, <value> );


     DESCRIPTION
          Monsters use all of the properties defined in the standard
          living object.  They also use the following special
          properties:

          stats
               A mapping whose keys are the names of the statistics
               and whose values are integers, in the default mudlib
               between 5 and 25 for players.  There is no enforced
               limitation on them other than that they must be an
               integer.  Players have four stats in the default:
               strength, constitution, dexterity, and intelligence.
               Monsters can have the same, fewer, or additional.  Each
               skill the monster has must have a stat to go with it,
               so that most monsters have a strength stat and a
               dexterity stat.

          hit_points
               An integer which is the current number of hits the
               beastie has.  The value 0 represents a (just) living
               monster, and -1 indicates it is no more.

          max_hp
               An integer which is the maximum number of hits the
               beastie can ever have.

          attack_strength
               A positive integer which indicates how likely it is
               that the monster will hit its target. 0 is quite
               unlikely, 10 is pretty good, 20 is awesome in the
               default mudlib. As usual, you can change these things.

          weapon_name
               A string that is the name of the weapon or body part
               the monster uses to make its attack.

          damage
               An array of two integers, the first being the minimum
               base damage the attack will do, and the second being
               the maximum base damage the attack will do. The base
               damage is further modified by stats, skills, and
               weapons.

          armor_class

               A positive integer indicating how resistant to being
               hit the monster is. 0 is unarmored, 10 is quite
               armored, and 20 is skin of steel in the default mudlib.
               Can be changed.

          aggressive
               An integer. If a monster's aggressive property is 1,
               the monster will attack any player entering the room
               automatically. If aggressive is 0, the monster will
               wait to be attacked before engaging in combat.
               set("aggressive",1) replaces set_aggressive(1) in most
               applications.
