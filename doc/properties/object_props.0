     SYNOPSIS
          set ( <property>, <value> );


     DESCRIPTION
          The following is a list of properties common to all objects

          short   A string which is the short description of the
                  object. set ("short", "foo") replaces
                  set_short("foo") in most applications.

          long    A string which is the long description of the
                  object. set ("long", "bar") replaces set_long("bar")
                  in most applications.

          id      An array of strings which are the names to which the
                  object will respond via the present() efun. set
                  ("id", ({ "biff", "bam", "kappow }) ) replaces
                  set_id (({ "biff", "bam", "kapow" })) for most
                  applications.

          light   An integer which is 1 if the object is a light
                  source and 0 if it is not. set ("light", 1) replaces
                  set_light(1) in most applications.

          mass    An integer which gives the mass of the object.  In
                  the default mudlib the mass of the player is 7500,
                  although you can change the scale to anything you
                  like. Players are limited to carrying 5000 mass
                  units, and you can change this too.

          bulk    An integer which gives the bulk of the object.  In
                  the default mudlib, a player bulks 1000 and can
                  carry up to 500 bulk units. You can change these
                  values if you like.
