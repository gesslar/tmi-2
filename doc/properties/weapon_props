Common Properties used by Weapons.

Weapons use all of the common properties defined by standard objects. In
addition, they use the following properties:

weapon. weapon is an integer which is the attack rating of the weapon. Any
object with an attack rating of 0 cannot be wielded. 1 is wimpy, 10 is quite
good, and 20 is megadeath in the default mudlib. You can change the meaning
of this property by altering the combat formula.

damage. damage is an array containing two integers. The integers are the
minimum and maximum amount of damage, respectively, that the weapon will
do. The base damage is further modified by skills and stats of the attacker
and target.

type. type is a string which controls the skill to be used in attacks made
with the weapon. In the default mudlib, a weapon of <type> uses the skill
"<type> weapons" in its attacks. If you change the skill system you will need
to tweak this also.

second. second is an integer. If second=1, the weapon can be used as the 
second of two weapons. Otherwise, it can only be the first of two weapons.

nosecond. nosecond is an integer. If nosecond=1, then players may not use
a second weapon or shield with this weapon (ie, it is two-handed).

wielded. wielded is an integer which is 1 if the weapon is being wielded by
a player and 0 if not.

wield_func. wield_func is a string: if it is defined, then the function
by that name will be called immediately after the weapon is wielded.

unwield_func. unwield_func is a string: if defined, the function by that
name will be called immediately after the weapon is unwielded.
