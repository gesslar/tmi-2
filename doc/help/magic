 
Magic, spells, etc...
 
First off, spells are performed by the 'cast' command. To use a spell such as
missile you would type:
>cast missile
 
However, you would want to put a name after the missile spell, to direct it
at someone. To do so simply type:
>cast missile foobird
 
This would cast a missile at the foobird.
 
There are several spells available. They are:
 
ATTACKS		HEALING		DIVINATIONS
-------		-------		-----------
missile		heal		message
fireball			vision
				invisibility
 
NOTE: When attacking and you cast a spell, you are too busy to do anything
else, including hitting the enemy. Be wary!
 
Also, you must first train in the magic guild for the spells you wish to
improve in. The more you train, the better the spells function.
