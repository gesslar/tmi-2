Comments
========
  ABERs and DIKUs are not case sensitive.  LPs and TINYs are.
  LPmuds send lines without returns on as prompts.  This can confuse some
    clients, so if you are using tinyfugue read /help lp
  LPmuds don't have command completion (but check the help entries for
    alias, nickname and history to see what they do have instead).
  As well as the "emote" command, LPmuds have some pre-written emotes
    to save typing.  Type "semote" to list them.
