			  Welcome to TMI-2


	This is our generic help start file.  If you see this on any
other mud, then then tell them to put their genre information in the
file "/doc/help/start".

	Our purpose at TMI-2 is to write a functional base for a role
playing adventure game using the MudOS driver.  We are not in the business of
supporting other people's creations or even our own past mistakes for free
anymore, at least until there's something newer to offer that's better.

	If you're experienced in LPC, and particularly with the more modern
stages of its growth, then we may be able to use your help if wish to offer it.
If you're not an experienced coder, we'd still like to hear from you in regards
to what you'd like to see in the ideal distribution mudlib.

	Feel free to post on the message boards any ideas you may wish to 
discuss or share.  If you're convinced that you wish to join our crazy band
of masochistic coders, then ... uh, talk to us, whoever seems to know what's
going on.  Eventually we'll know who you are and be able to make a decision
about whether we can spare some disk space for you, etc.
