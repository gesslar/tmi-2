   TMI-2 runs a utility called FTPD on its host machine. This lets wizards
load files from their own machines up to TMI-2 and also download files
from TMI-2 to their local machine. This means that people can get fixed
mudlib files straight from the mudlib instead of placing copies on the
anonymous FTP site. It also means that people who are coding test objects
in /open can save those files to their local disk space (since we don't
have enough to give away.)
   The FTPD works exactly like ftp does in UNIX. If you don't know how to
use ftp in UNIX, try going back to your local machine and typing "man ftp".
This should help you learn to use ftp.
   To use it here, you use the ftp command at your local host to connect
to port 5554 of this machine (tmi.ccs.neu.edu). Wheit asks for your
account name, enter the name of your character. When it asks for a password,
enter your character's password (it won't show up on the screen). Then you
can use the normal cd/ls/get/put commands of ftp to move around the mudlib
and load or download files. You should be able to download almost any file
in the mudlib, and you should be able to upload files into /open or into
your directory if you have one.
   Due to a bug in our FTPD script, you may find that any files you upload
can't be written by the driver. You'll get an error like "Unable to open
file foo for write". If you get that, just cp the file to a new name, and
then things will work fine.
