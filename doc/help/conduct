General Conduct
---------------
   
   In general, keep in mind that, for many, MU*'s are not merely "games",
but are extensions of reality.  If you treat MU* in this manner, you are much
less likely to run into problems.  Don't do things that you would not do in
everyday life unless the genre is conducive to such behaviour. Wizards
who are inconsiderate, rude, or insulting to other wizards will generally be
warned for a first offense, and if the inappropriate behavior persists, the
offending wizard may be dewizzed, nuked, or his/her site may be banned. If
you abide by the "do unto others as you would wish done to you" rule of thumb,
you shouldn't have any problems.
