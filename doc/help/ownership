Code Ownership/Privacy
----------------------               
   When you code a file, you must assume that everyone else can read that
file, and can therefore use what the file contains for their own purposes.
When writing code that will be integrated into the mudlib, your code will
be moved out of your home directory.  This code now belongs to the MUD
and you no longer have any rights to it (ie: removing it from the mud if
you should leave).  Any code that may _not_ be copied and extended, should
be clearly marked with comments to that effect.  It is polite to ask a
wizard's permission before you copy anything from his or her personal
directory. If you copy and extend and code, you must give credit to the
original author(s) if known, and respect existing file headers and comments
in that code.

   Outright plagiarism is highly frowned upon here.  However, the "copy 
and modify" approach to learning the language is a time-proven method, 
so if you should engage in this practice, be _sure_ to credit whatever 
authors have worked on the code before you.
