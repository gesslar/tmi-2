The TMI-2 Mudlib supports several different sets of escape sequences
for maximum compatibility with the various terminal emulations out there.
Most terminal emulations (vt100) for example either use the full ansi
escape sequences or the sequences for bolding.  TMI-2 supports the
following escape sequence protocols:

ansi
ansi-status
freedom
xterm
unknown (this is default, for non-colour terminals)

Use the <call> command to set your terminal protocol.
Ex: call me;set_term;ansi
Check <help colour> to see how to say things in colour.
Note that many mud clients use escape sequences, and therefore may become
confused by certain terminal types.  "unknown" will never mess up.
