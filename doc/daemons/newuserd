/adm/daemons/newuserd.c

newuserd.c is the daemon object that handles brand new users (as opposed to
brand 'X', the existing user).  The only expected external entry is from the
login daemon to the create_new_user() function.  The player is prompted for
a password; predefined if an email-registered character or defined and checked
at this time if an open-join.

After password entry, any other information needed to begin a character is
prompted for.  The standard questions are for gender, race, email address and
real name (optional), but this can be extended at will.  The ability to quit
the entry system is a useful one here - generally too many incorrect entries
is the method of quitting.

After these user entries, the daemon sets up starting statistics and skills
for the character (the set_skill() lfun is used here).  No functions in 
newuserd.c are designed to be called by external modules.
