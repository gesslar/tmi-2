	* yielding to peer pressure, moved the weather daemon doc to 
	/doc/daemons, and changed the name to weather_d.c to conform.

	* late addition to changelog - topuserd doc finished by Blue, 26th 
	aug. Don't know who originally started it but they only wrote 
	one line. I've followed Karathan's format (I think) which he 
	used in the banish doc.

	* New banish document from Karathan, includes the mailreg 
	functions.
