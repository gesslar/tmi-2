We usually only give directories to staff members and other people who
have contributed code to the mudlib. What you can do, if you like, is
edit files in /open. You can write files there, you can load them and
clone them, and you can use the FTPD process (running on port 5554 of
the same machine) to save them back to your local file space. Files in
/open get erased every morning at 6am MUD time, so you have that long to
copy them back to your own disk space before you lose them. We like to
let people code here but we don't have enough disk space to give it
out to anyone except the staff... but if you can provide your own file
storage you can do everything else here.
If you don't know LPC, or don't know much and want to learn more, you
can also try to become a student. All you have to do is post on the student
request board, asking someone to be your teacher. However, since we
have many more people who want to be students than who want to teach,
not all people who request student status actually get it. But you can
ask and see what happens.
If you want a permanent directory, you must have a mudlib coding project
that you will work on. You can read the IDEAS log and try to find ideas
for projects there. If you notice something that the TMI-2 mudlib needs
but doesn't have, you can suggest your own project to the admins; however,
the admin will make the final decision on whether or not TMI-2 needs a
given project or does not. Sometimes other places like the mudlib bugs
board or the projects board contain ideas for projects as well. Note that
to get a directory for a project you must convince us that you have the
coding skills to complete your project; some past coding experience is
generally, though not always, required.
