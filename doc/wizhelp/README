This directory documents all standard commands that a wizard have.
Note that some of these may have changed from the way they are
described in these documents.  If you find this is the case,

Well, most of this stuff is now in the help() functions in the commands
themselves. Some massive hacking and slashing should be done in this dir.
Help files for wizards belong here, such as the wiz-help, rather than
help on specific commands.
For example, if a mud stores files describing the theme of the mud, the
layout of the areas, and other stuff that a wizard creating rooms might
need to know, this would be an excellent place to stuff it.
