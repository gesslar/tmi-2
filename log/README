    /log/

    This directory contains your mud system logs.  To better organize
    logs, subdirectories such as the following can be helpful:

        /log/admin/     - should be reserved for admin sensitive functions
        /log/driver/    - should be the directory used by your startmud script
                          to redirect driver output
        /log/network/   - should be reserved for network related functions
