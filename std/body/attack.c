// Basic structure:
// The function kill_ob is used to initiate combat. The kill command calls
// it in any monster or player entering combat, as do the combat spells and
// other nastiness. It also turns on a monster's heartbeat if that is
// necessary.
// The heart_beat calls the continue_attack function. This function checks
// to see if the monster is dead and if so, starts the death sequence. It
// then checks the list of current opponents and removes any that are dead
// or otherwise out of the MUD. Opponents that have left the room are moved
// onto the "will_kill" list. It then checks to see if spellcasting or
// other activity has blocked the attack. If not, it calls execute_attack
// which does the actual attack against the first attacker on the list.
// The functions continue_attack and execute_attack are defined seperately
// in each body.
