 
  This is the mud's root directory.  It holds all the primary subdirectories
  within the mud.  No files should be placed here, and it should be kept
  as tidy as possible.
 
  See /doc/wizhelp/directories for a detailed explanation of how this
  directory is organized and where to find things in it.
