With regret, due tothe fact that TMI can only handle a finite number of connections, prioritymay have to be given to users with a special interest in the subject, suchas users with the authority to represent the players or the administrationof their mud on this issue.  Membership will be limited to 100, so registering in advance is important.The purpose of the conference as a whole is to increase understandingbetween admins and players about what standards of behaviour eachexpect and are prepared to give, and to exchange information aboutthe desirability of various possible MU* behaviour policies, theirlegal implications, and how well they actually work in practice.The conference will focus on the following three topics:1. Rights, Privileges, and Obligations  Do players possess any rights at all, and if so what are they? Doadministrators incur any obligations by opening a MU*, either under law orethically, and if so what are they? Does a player implicitly agree to anyrights/obligations by remaining logged onto a MU*? What restrictions areplaces on MU*s by Usenet or by law? We intend this part of the conferenceto help clarify people's ideas about what they may expect to exist at allMU*s and when a MU* player or admin has violated the law or another user'srights.2. Privacy and Harrassment  What privileges are commonly granted to users by MU* admins, and what arethe advantages and disadvantages of doing so? Is a MU* required to guaranteethe privacy of users? If not, is a MU* that does not guarantee privacyrequired to state that fact explicitly? Is a MU* administrator required toenforce some code of acceptable behavior between players on the MU*? If aMU* does not enforce acceptable behavior, must the MU* explicitly state thefact that it does not? If it does, must it make the standards of acceptablebehavior on the MU* know to its users? Under what conditions may a MU* adminmake a user's private behavior known to other users, or to the community as awhole? We intend this part of the conference to help guide new MU* adminsin choosing wise policies to enforce on their MU*s.3. Code Ownership   Who controls the code that makes up the MU*? Who has the right to changeit, add to it, or delete it? Are existing MU*s in compliance with existingintellectual property law? How much imitation of another wizard's work isacceptable? When does imitation become piracy? When does a wizard give upcontrol of his code to the MU* administrator? We intend this part of theconference to clarify people's expectations of code ownership, and helpreduce the incidence of MU*s being destroyed by arguments over code control.Pre-Conference Submissions and Post-Conference RecordsAt the Singlenesia ethics conference, many participants felt that too muchtime was spent stating positions and not enough time was spent discussingthem. To avoid this problem, TMI-2 is receiving pre-conference submissionswhich will be made available to the public. Such submissions may come intwo forms; position statements or proposals for the approval of theconference. Anyone is welcome to make submissions. Position statementsshould clearly address one of the above topics, and should not be longerthan 5000 characters. The best position statements will be selected forpresentation at the conference. Preference will be given to statementswhich discuss one issue in detail rather than those which discuss manyissues in little depth. The authors of selected statments will be giventime to present their statements and compare them to others on the sametopic, with general discussion following the presentations.  Proposals for the approval of the conference will be voted on at the endof the conference. Any registered attendee will be permitted to vote.At the end of the conference, a list of all submitted proposals and theresults of the votes on them will be made public. Proposals should notbe longer than 100 words and are subject to the approval of the conveners.Proposals which are very similar may be combined into a single proposalwith joint authorship, if all authors approve. In addition to the proposals,logs of the conference will be available to the public at TMI-2.  Both statements and proposals should be mailed to mud-ethics@cats.ucsc.edu,and should be clearly labeled in the subject header as either statements orproposals for the ethics conference.Schedule of Events:February 14th: Last day to submit statements and proposals.February 15th: Accepted statements and proposals made public.February 17th: (all times Pacific Standard)  4:30 pm. Pre-conference get together. The basic features of LP MUDs willbe discussed for non-LP attendees.  4:45 pm. Registration.  5 pm: Opening statement by conference conveners.  5:10 pm: Conference moves into meeting rooms, one per topic. Presentationsof position statements.  5:30 pm: General discussion of topics. Amendments to proposals may be made.  7:00 pm: Voting on amendments. Final proposals taken to voting room.  7:15-7:45 pm: Informal discussion of proposals, and voting.  7:45 pm: Votes tabulated and results announced. Plans made for nextconference, if attendees desire another round.  8 pm: Conference adjourns.FacilitiesThe conference will take place in the TMI-2 conference center. This facilityfeatures four meeting rooms in which discussion will be held. These roomshave a number of features designed to enhance discussion such as permittinga single attendee to speak uninterrupted, silencing or ejecting unrulyparticipants, a built-in clock to time speakers and votes, logging ofmeeting proceedings, and echoing to an observation room. The conferencecenter also features a voting room where users may vote on the proposalsbefore the conference, a registration room, and a wet bar and discussionarea where people may withdraw for public or private informal chats aboutthe issues.  Discussion in each meeting room is controlled by a moderator. Individualswishing to serve as moderators are encouraged to volunteer: to do so, sendmail to mud-ethics@cats.ucsc.edu.  Anyone wishing to inspect the conference center before the meeting andlearn how it works in more detail is invited to do so. Log into TMI atany time and type \"conf\" in the start room. You will find yourself in theentrance to the conference center.  Please feel free to re-post this notice anywhere that non-usenet readingusers from your mud might have access to it.Conference Conveners:		Douglas Reay     ( Pallando@TMI-2)				Adam Beeman	 ( Buddha@TMI-2)				Steve Schmidt	 ( Mobydick@TMI-2)","title":"Announcing the Conference on MU* Ethics","id":2,]),(["poster":"Pallando","time":735861793,"title":"Announcing a Conference on TMI's future","body":"Recently TMI-2's purpose has mainly been to produce for distributiona mudlib that utilises the features of the MudOS LPmud driver.In this period it has also served the MUD community as a whole(eg running conferences) and the LPmud community in particular(eg keeping a central intermud list) - something that our current location (ccs.northeastern) also does (eg its ftp site).In the past, TMI has acted as a driver delevopment site, an LPCteaching site and bug-fixing centre.  It has not so far actedas a conventional game, as per Nightmare, Genesis and Discworld.It is time for change again.  Now we have distributed a mudlib,Buddha and Mobydick are taking this opertunity to move on toother things (though they will still log in from time to time).[ NB this means Mobydick is still staying around.  Just being less active.]Therefore they are holding a conference here at 5pm, this Sunday,on the role TMI should play in the future.

They have waited until the distributionwas out and certainly have a right to move on to new things.(Can we say enhanced BuddhaMUD driver? 8-)   I want to take thisopertunity to thank them on my own behalf for the benefit I'vegained from all their hard work.

THis didn'treally work too well on the old TMI, because it invited politics.Instead, there should be one central guild, ahd here's how it should work:Sages:  These are the people who, essentially, are in charge of thepolitical side of the MUD.  THey keep track of who getsdirectories, who gets promotions etc.Adepts:  there are the people who work on the mudlib and driver, andgenerally don't need to be interested in the politics.  Their oneresponsibility would be to make sure the MUD is running welland effeciently. Initiates:  these are people who are very good at MUDOS coding,and are interested in teaching it to others.  They concernthemselves with the lower ranks, answering questions, and settingup classes if they are so inclined.Apprentice through seeker: These are the actual builders of theMUD, and are the ones who are here to learn MUDOS and how thingswork.  APprentice would be the most advanced of these, andseekers would be beginners who hardly know anything.A test should be set up to decide who should get what positionintially as we attempt to staff up, however after we've gottena considerable staff together we should start everyone at seekerlevel and go from there.That's about it I guess, I will be at the conference, if you likemy idea then help me back it up there :)Forlock","title":"TMI'S FUTURE","id":5,]),(["poster":"Runn","time":746665595,"title":"New server meeting","body":"The new server meeting will be held in conf room A at 7pm PSTyour moderator will be Runn from Perilous Realms.
