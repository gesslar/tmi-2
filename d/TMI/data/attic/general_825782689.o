Let us give you a hand.We're CII: Common Internet Inc., a Canadian-based Internet ServiceProvider, providing a wide range of Internet solutions to customers inmany communities.We're now offering the opportunity to give your MUD, chat server, talker,or whatever other multi-user system you want to run a chance to have asolid, stable home that won't go away when the school year ends, or whenyou change jobs.For $100.00 (Canadian currency, about $70-75 U.S.) per month, you'll have:- 100 MB of space on our dedicated MUD server.- Access to the latest GNU compilation tools for compiling your system,  as well as alternative compilers such as GPC (GNU Pascal Compiler) and  others for alternative development projects.- An interactive account on the system, for receiving mail about your  multi-user system, and for putting up World Wide Web pages to advertise  your project.- Free nameservice for your mud; if you already have a domain name, we'll  host it for you, and if you want one, we can help you obtain your own, or  we'll give your a \"common.net\" name for free.  (Internic fees may apply  for some domain name registrations.)- Free backup service.- No limitations on the type of software you want to run: anything from  LPmuds to MOOs and everything in between.- Some limited technical support (we can help you get a few MUD types that  we have direct experience with operating, and can give you help with  navigating gcc, gdb, and other tools).- Most importantly, a quick and stable home for your MUD.We're currently taking reservations; space is limited, so contact us earlyto ensure that you have a place for your MUD to call home!Please direct all enquiries to:Common Internet Inc.P.O.
