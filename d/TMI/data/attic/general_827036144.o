It usually occurs on larger files: certain parts are duplicated,as if the daemon is sending a chunk, then sending the end of that chunk again.If anyone knows what is causing this, please let me know, so I can get itfixed.Thanks,Dabius","time":825631155,"poster":"Dabius","title":"Re: < no title >",]),(["id":180,"body":"It is a shame that this is no longer the 'Great Place' that it was.

No kidding? I have read the login screen before, you know.That wasn't my point. My point is that this is the rebirth of TMI-2 witha few changes. The fact still remains that I never see as many people here.I am not saying that no one is ever here to answer questions, just that itseems that when I log in that I am the only person. It's lonely and notthe place I once knew. It's a shame. So what if the damn name if different,this is still based on the same idea (mostly).Btw, Team Aye sounds a tad like TMI when pronounced, no? Not sayin this is badbut I do find it interesting. Therefore in a sense this is still TMI to me.- Mk","time":825752575,"poster":"Moksha","title":"Re: *sigh*",]),(["id":184,"body":"On Sat Mar  2, Leto wrote:> On Sat Mar  2, Moksha wrote:> > It is a shame that this is no longer the 'Great Place' that it was.

What is also rather depressing is the fact that suchplaces have sites whereas muds who really have a fan base have lost theirs.I am not saying that these 'clearing houses' are bad. If anything theseplaces are a much needed thing. It is nice to be able to get a lib and driverand try and set it up knowing that if you have a problem that you can alwaysask for help.Anyway, enough.

What people seem to fail to realize isthat the place isn't really as important as the people; people tend toshow up and discuss things wherever they can find other people, etc,and collect around wherever new ideas tend to be springing up.
