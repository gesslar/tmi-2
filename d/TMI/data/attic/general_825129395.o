Just rather curious...it was put up as Tmi-2. But certain people thought that as long asit didn't supply the ideals that Tmi-2 had, the name should not beused. A while ago, both Buddha and Mobydick said I could use thename if we strived the same goals as Tmi-2. Since this was put upmainly to supoprt the tmi-2 1.3 libs, and some people were sort ofagainst it, I decided that it was better not named Tmi-2.> (and a quick suggestion: why not bring up the old TMI-2 quad again,> just to give the place a little bit of the old feel?

When we moved from Kendall, things were cleared there aftera while. We got into problems with an unstable mudcat machine, andmeanwhile robo had to delete the archives at actlabs because theywere running out of diskspace. When we moved to enterprise we burnedour retreat (We didn't happily split up with Jim :) and Henrik fromEnterprise told everyone he made regular backups etc. Whenenterprise went down heavily (disk failure) tapes couldn't be restored.On top of that Henrik suddenly left shv.se, leaving us basicallywith nothing (If there was anything left at all to begin with).but, yours truly was working on 1.3 and had a pretty recent copy ofthe corelib (not /data or /u though). That's what became the 1.3pre releases.So, if someone thought the quad was such a cool area, that they copied it, feel free to upload it ;)But honestly, I am wondering if this site is worth its cpu cyclesit is using.

The basic fact is that all libs thatget turned into a 'real' mud (for whatever that term is worth)all require hacking, IMHO.   I personally am comfortable with TMI's basics. I've grown usedto them, and I believe that in time even the cpu-intensive functionscan be re-written, etc.    Just for my two cents, I do think this place is worth the CPU. Iam making many changes to the default mudlib for Mostly Harmless, andam planning on offering many of those changes up to TMI, oranyone else running a derivative that wants to use them.> > Leto> > Ps.

I'd be supportive of anyefforts to jump-start the lib, but for what are probably obviousreasons, I probably would never go back to taking an active role inthe maintainence of the TMI mudlib...Rust","time":822630754,"poster":"Rust","title":"Re: Team-Aye / TMI",]),(["id":139,"body":"Euh, I made a small mistake.

Make the raw materials eitherhave a function or a property which returns the info needed totell the smith wether or not it can use it for something.
