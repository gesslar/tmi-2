Which driver/lib version are you running?We are currently stuck on a Solaris PC, and I the machine is plagued witha knack for crashing. When I compiled a driver with debug on, I noticed thatit was crashing mostly for the reason that the stack returned F_RETURN,which apparently the driver does NOT like.
