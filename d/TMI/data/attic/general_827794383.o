Almost all nonames weredue to either the user or the connection datafile to be lost.And if that's gone, there really isn't enough data to 'fix' a noname.Leto","id":203,]),(["title":"Re: Some characters not restoring properly?","poster":"Lucas","time":826998677,"body":"On Sat Mar 16, Leto wrote:> About the Noname stuff.> > This is usually a permission problem, or a harddisk is almost full> problem.We've had that problem on Avatar.
