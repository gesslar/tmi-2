I sort of figured out a way to implement thestack security but I am boggled about privs. Mainly its becauseI have little knowledge of them. I guess the concept is that when-ever an object is created the driver calls a function in master.ccalled privs_file, which I guess I have to make myself. Privs_filereturns a priv string and the driver tacks it on the object. Then,whenever I need to know whether the object is OK to do something,I call query_privs on the object and make something of the returnstring.  Is all this right so far?Can a priv string be anything?Is there a limit on its length?How much does the 4 bytes per object affect my mud's speed etcIs there a mudlib other than Nightmare which uses this effectively?Grr I hate it when I dont know something :)-Olive Juice","time":820005375,"poster":"Olive","title":"< no title >",]),(["id":116,"body":"We have the man pages of those driver efuns here.

Maybe on a Pentium Pro 180Mhz with 128 meg RAMthere is no need for them, but in current computers it's nice to have.

So, I can't tell you right now if it's possibleor not. In the worst case, make a grid with an unreachableline in between, and make the two areas on the other sides ofthat line.Eg: a b c d e f x x x g h i j k lThen make no entries or exits at 'x' places.You'll get one grid but two 'areas'(Yes, I know it's lame hack :)Leto","id":129,]),(["title":"Why I said Grids Suck","poster":"Lucas","time":822170805,"body":"I meant that they are normally boring rooms with not much in them.I, personally, don't like Virtual Areas much, but if you place a lot of wandering monsters, it makes people happy.*shrug* thanks for he suggestions	-lucas-","id":130,]),(["title":"Team-Aye / TMI","poster":"Logic","time":822454943,"body":"Just to get a little discussion going here again, what is the currentdeal with TMI-2?
