Doesn't take much of a performance hit to return 0all over the place in the master.You really underestimate the speed of LPC if you're worried aboutverification of a call stack that rarely gets more than 5 or 6 itemsdeep being slow.","id":49,]),(["title":"Re: stack security and uids","poster":"Hanzou","time":828897540,"body":"On Sun Apr  7, Leto wrote:> That's basically what some functions already do.
