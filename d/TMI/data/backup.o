Personally, I've found that v22a3 is very unstable, but it could be    stable for other people. v21.6 seems to work okay, except that it    messes up memory info statistics. Make sure you've disabeled the    /adm/daemons/mem_checker daemon which will otherwise reboot your mud   because it is thinking you're using way too much memory.   (Either remove it from the /adm/etc/preload file, or just add some   nonsense in the file so it won't update.","id":55,]),(["id":56,"body":"We were getting too many notes for this one board, so I quicklycreated a few more board rooms.
