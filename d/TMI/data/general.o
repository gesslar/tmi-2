So, you had toprovoke a mud into sending you one to see if it was still around.The I3 protocol uses TCP, which is a point-to-point connection, soyou can always tell without extra efford if the mud is there.All muds on the mudlist have an open tcp connection to the I3 routeras we speak. The router sends us a message when it loses a mud.Leto","time":830020884,"poster":"Leto","title":"Re: DNS_MASTER",]),(["id":266,"body":"I've had several people asking me questions about new things,implementations, bugfixes and other things they wanted to workon in the last couple of weeks.
