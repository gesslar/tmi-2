Scan through lib source, and make sure objects that need the BOARD
define get it from one file...it's currently defined in both mailer.h and
mudlib.h...and cause a redefinition warning on some files (eg /cmds/wiz/_mail.c)

Bug : Robocoder at Sun Nov 26 01:52:49 1995 in /d/TMI/rooms/quad
ChangeLog entries are screwy; it's being added incorrectly to /log/ChangeLog.
Looks like the last line in /log/ChangeLog is being used to store the new
entry...so it may not even be the current working directory

Double check and fix channels.
Intermud channels are called imud_code and imud_gossip. Here we're
translating them to code and gwiz.
Prob change gwiz into igossip. code can stay the same
Esp with emotes we get problems. Eg referencing gwiz is fine , except when using emotes

Something wrong in the i3 daemon... the router_socket object is destructed
for some reason, and causes the i3 daemon to get out of sync, and die on
i3 requests

add screen_size stuff in logon and user

Query : Thystonius at Sat Mar  9 06:50:01 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/quad
I have been reading all through your documentation.  Unfortunately
Some of it points to a creation.c file supposably located in
/adm/obj..

Any idea of what happened to it would surely be of help.  I'm trying
to get my mud up and running, and I think TMI is one of the best
documented systems.  I would like to look at the stat structure,
race structure, and change them.

> ' %^RED%^Test%^RESET%^
You say: %^RED%^Test%^RESET%^

I think this is because the driver write() doesnt call
relay_message in the user object.

Typo : Slc at Mon May  6 00:35:14 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/quad
In /adm/daemons/network/I3/finger.c
you should rather use format "%d" than "%s" for the idle time "info[11]/60"!
I suppose, this is a TYPO, not a real bug...

Bug : Ciao at Mon May  6 07:49:04 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/bugroom
I did an rlog all, and saw brainstorm's complaint about color, in
correct colors... when I viewed it with log BUGS, I saw it with the
% ^ things still in there.
also, I ftp'd in a color _who.c (~ciao/cmds/_colorwho.c) and it also
doens't work right.... I see the % ^ COLOR % ^ strings.

Idea : Ciao at Mon May  6 07:50:43 1996 in /d/TMI/rooms/bugroom
I have a niiiice version of _who.c that shows uses color and give
a bit more information than the regular _who.c  it's ~ciao/cmds/_colorwho.c
once you get write to correctly parse % ^ COLOR % ^ strings, you might
want to install it.

_support.c - this commands still seems to use the DNS_MASTER.
Either its obsolut due to the mudlist which shows service or
it should be fixed to use I3 now.
