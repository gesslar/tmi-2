    /www/

    This directory contains the mud's home page, other html pages, and
    gateway services.  The daemon is located in /adm/daemons/network/http.c.
    Your http port number is defacto your mud's login port number minus 5.
    For example, if your login port number is 5000, then your http port is
    4995.  Your URL would be something like:

        http://my.site.net:4995/

    Users with home directories can create home pages by creating a
    public_html/ subdirectory in their home directory.  The URL
    to a user's index.html file would be something like:

        http://my.site.net:4995/~user/index.html
    or:
        http://my.site.net:4995/home/user/index.html
